# Spark React ES6

Sample ReactJS application which uses the Spark framework on the server side which is quite useful for quickly
prototyping an application.  On the front end, code is written in ES6, but admittedly this was my first foray into ES6
so some code may not be optimized as such.  Gulp build will output a separate vendor and scripts bundle using
Browserify with the Babelify transform.
